EVERDAY
===========================

## What is Everday?

Everday is a more-or-less text based, space themed, 4x RPG developed in VueJS. While it will feature minor multiplayer elements, the base design is for a single player experience with an emphasis on story driven gameplay and open world exploration.

Players take on the role of leading a fledgling federation that just discovered faster than light (FTL) travel. This is an expensive method of travel, and players must keep track of their resources or risk losing armies to the depths of space forever.
